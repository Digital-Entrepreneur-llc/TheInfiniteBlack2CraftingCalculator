Current problems/to do list:

Remove scroll bar from the repair kits and interdictor mod when a faction is selected.
Emperor Ships need - 300k for N/A, also Ship Mod can be Paladin as default/loaded.
The Godhead needs to be added as emperor
The size right now visually accommodates everything just remove all the scrolls. 

let me know if you find any other issues. or things to improve on.
